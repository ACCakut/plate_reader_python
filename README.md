# plate_reader_python
Some Python scripts to analyse OD growth curves from plate readers as those from Tecan.

This is a poorly maintained and updated repository of scripts I created that could also be useful for others. These scripts are neither well tested nor sophisticated nor documented properly. **Absolutely no warranty, that they function as intended.**

Feel free to use and adapt the code as you like. Pull requests and issues are welcome but I cannot give time-consuming support.


## import_Tecan.py
Provides function import_Tecan_xlsx to extract OD values from Tecan i-controlâ„¢ software saved in Excel spreadsheets and returns a nice pandas dataframe. Documentation is part of the code.
```
from import_Tecan import *
import_Tecan_xlsx("your-file.xlsx")
```




## Legacy code metrics (How reliable this code is)

O++ S++ I C-- E- M- V- !PS D-

Inspired by fefe.

### Legacy Code: Ownership, Contingency

**O++ Public domain / MIT / Apache**

O+  Copyleft

O   We own it. But if we go under, you get the source code.

O-  We own it. You get a license we can revoke at any time.

O-- We own it. We don't sell it. You can only rent it.

!O  You use our appliance / cloud service.

### Legacy Code: Source Code

**S++ The source code is public and you can change it**

S+  The source code is public

S   The source code leaked a while ago

S-  We let the government view the source code

S-- The source code is secret

!S  We lost the source code

### Legacy Code: Intent, Confidence

I+++ I make actual guarantees

I++  I have done this multiple times before. I know what I'm doing.

I+   I had to adapt the design a bit over time

**I    I tried to avoid security bugs while writing this**

I-   Look, they paid me to do this

I--  The guy left. Code now maintained by team in India

!I   I have no idea what I'm doing

### Legacy Code: Correctness

C+++ We have a correctness proof and you can understand/verify it

C++  We have a correctness proof

C+   No open bugs, 100% test coverage and we do regular code audits

C    We try to fix bugs that our users tell us about

C-   We have a bug backlog

**C--  At some point we are planning to gave a bug tracking system**

!C   That's not really a bug, that's just a crash!

### Legacy Code: Engineering, Design

E+++  Least Privilege, Privilege Separation, TCB minimized

E++   We sandbox ourselves away so nothing bad can happen

E     We try to detect bad arguments

**E-    Well... we fix bugs. That's good, right?**

E--   We just do what we are told. You call us wrong, that's on you!

E---  We run as root / in the kernel

E---- We sell it as an appliance so you don't see how bad it is

!E    We do a daily AI malware scan of our blockchain


### Legacy Code: Maintenance

M!   Author is Don Knuth / Dan Bernstein, makes no mistakes.

M+   Project is feature/complete, get occasional security updates

M    Project gets updated regularly

**M-   People send pull requests / patches to mailing list**

M--  Vendor publishes quarterly patch roundup with 512 fixes each

M--- Author killed project. Unoficial forks / backups still around.

!M   Author left / dead, project abandoned

### Legacy Code: Volatility

V!   Software is perfect, needed no updates since 1993

V++  Like V+ but has a way to notify you of new versions

V+   Regular patches and updates but you can't tell the difference 

**V-   Updating is such a hassle that backporting patches is a thing**

V--  The new version broke so much, most people use the old one 

V--- Agile. 5 updates/day, half of them break production

!V   Support ended

### Legacy Code: Protocol / Spec

PS++  The spec is public, short and precise

PS    The spec is OK but interoperability is a bitch

PS-   The spec is so large, nobody implements all of it

PS--  The spec cannot be implemented securely

PS--- There is a spec but it's paywalled

**!PS   The author made it up as he went**

### Legacy Code: Dependencies

!D   No dependencies. You boot our image directly.

D++  We depend only on things that come with the system

D+   We depend on sqlite and libz

D    We use somebody's Docker image from the Internet

**D-   We don't even have a list of the dependencies**

D--  We load extensions dynamically from the Internet

D--- Uses vendor specific lock-in APIs/features
